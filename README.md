Title: Intelligent Modeling and Thermal-Aware Predictive Analysis of PRAM: A Multi-Domain Approach Integrating Machine Learning and Device Physics

This work presents a comprehensive modeling and predictive framework for Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PRAM) devices by integrating physical simulations, machine learning models, and statistical drift analysis. Twenty-eight figures were developed to capture key operational metrics such as RESET temperature, resistance drift, energy dissipation, thermal budget, endurance limits, retention behaviour, and multi-bit window separability. LSTM models, Arrhenius-based thermal models, exponential resistance drift equations, and clustering/classification methods were applied to real and simulated datasets to evaluate accuracy, lifetime, and failure thresholds. Results demonstrate highly accurate RESET temperature forecasting, robust thermal budget integration, and reliable resistance drift projections. Additionally, the adoption of adaptive refresh and activation energy tuning significantly extends device retention and endurance. The study also benchmarks PRAM read/write latency and energy performance at the system level. Collectively, the presented methods enable predictive design, reliability management, and scalability improvements for next-generation non-volatile memories.
